## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies

With **Expo (recommended):**

```bash
npm install
npx expo install react-native-gesture-handler
```

> `expo install` ensures compatibility with your Expo SDK.

If using bare React Native (after ejecting):

```bash
npm install
npm i react-native-gesture-handler
npx pod-install   # iOS only
```

---

### 2. Run the app

```bash
npx expo start
```

* Press **a** → Android emulator (if running)
* Press **i** → iOS simulator (macOS)
* Or scan the QR code in **Expo Go** (Android/iOS)

Clear cache if needed:

```bash
npx expo start -c
```

## 🎮 Usage

* ➕ **Add task** — type in the field, press **Enter** or tap **+**
* ✏️ **Edit task** — tap a row
* ✅ **Complete task** — swipe right to reveal “Complete”, release to trigger
* ↩️ **Undo** — tap **UNDO** in the snackbar (appears for ~4s)
